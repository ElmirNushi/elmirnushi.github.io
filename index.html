                        <p>At the 2nd year of College, Universum gave us a small job to help us understand better how to

                            so they decided to send us to some of the High Schools in Gjakova to teach 3rd year High
                            School students how to make a simple web page with HTML/CSS/JS, it was a pretty
                            good experience because we got to work in a group with other college students!</p>

                <p>My biggest hobby I would say is video games, whenever I have free time I like to spend them in
                    playing video games with my friends. I like video games because I enjoy being a part of a
                    community.</p>
                <p>Another hobby of mine is gym/running, I feel like especially as programmer it helps you a lot to keep
                    your body in a good shape, but not only that, it
                    helps a lot mentally too!</p>
